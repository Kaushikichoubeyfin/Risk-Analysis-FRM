>Financial Risk Analysis- Market Risk / Portfolio risk spanning VaR( Parametric, Historical), ES, Backtesting and Bond Price sensitivity to interest rates
"This repository contains Excel-based models for analyzing **market risk** and **interest rate risk** using real financial data.

## Market Risk / Portfolio Risk

The model evaluates portfolio exposure using **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall/ CVaR** methods.  
> HDFC Bank, SBI, Adani, Indian Bank, TCS, ONGC, ZEE Entertainment, LIC, Zomato, and Nykaa.
- **VaR Methods** Parametric (Variance–Covariance) and Historical Simulation.
- **Expected Shortfall** Measures the average loss beyond the VaR threshold.  
- **Backtesting** 
  The model shows how portfolio risk estimates change across different confidence levels and validates accuracy through backtesting results.

## Interest Rate Risk

This model estimates the sensitivity of bond prices to interest rate changes using **Duration and Convexity**.  
- Bonds analyzed:
  - **SBI 8.25% CADs**
  - **Payment Services Ltd (8 Aug 2034 maturity)**
  - **Frequency-Yearly**
Demonstrates how changes in yield impact bond valuation and how duration–convexity can be used for risk control.
